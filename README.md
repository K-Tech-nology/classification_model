# Model for forecasting using Classification Model
Classification Model has been used by businesses to predicted 0 and 1 ( True or False ) value. In addition to that, there are some cases where the value is wider than 0 and 1 ( Multiclass ). 

In this module, I will be showing several use cases on how to create a classification model using different datasets.

Feel free to submit a pull request If you have a better way to optimize the code I posted here.
